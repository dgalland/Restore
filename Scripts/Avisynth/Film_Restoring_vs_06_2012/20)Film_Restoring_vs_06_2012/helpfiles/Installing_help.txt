How to install the film restoring script and the plugins.
=========================================================


1) Create a special folder for the scripts and plugins only.

2) Unpack the zipfile to this folder


You should now have the following subfolders:
===============================================

HELPFILES
SCRIPTS
SOURCECODE


In the "scripts" folder you will find 5 scripts:
================================================


01_A_Film_Restoring_Frame_Interpolation.avs
--------------------------------------------

This is the main script with all options.


01_B_Film_Restoring_Frame_Blending.avs
--------------------------------------

This is the same script, but with frame blending instead of frame interpolation.
This can be useful for films with fast moving objects.
Because interpolation sometimes gives artefacts on high motion scenes.


01_C_Film_Restoring_Blending_Cleaning_only.avs
-----------------------------------------------

This script is using the RemoveDirtMC cleaning, but no degraining afterwards.
It is using blending instead of interpolation too.
It will render a lot faster, and the end result will leave some filmgrain.
For those who like the specific 'film' look.


01_D_Film_Restoring_Blending_No_Cleaning.avs
---------------------------------------------

This script will render very fast.
It can be used for fast resizing, cropping, stabilizing, and levels and color tweaking.
There will be no cleaning and no degraining.



01_E_Stabilisation_Only.avs
============================

This script does stabilisation almost in real time.
It is very useful to test the stabilising parameters.
The result is the same as "ResultS7" in the other scripts.



ATTENTION:
==========

For some reason fftw3.dll can not be placed in the "plugins" folder.
fftw3.dll must be together with the scripts in the same folder, otherwise it will not work.
fftw3.dll is used by Depan.



The "scripts" folder should have a subfolder named "plugins"
============================================================

inside this subfolder should be:
-----------------------------------

03_RemoveDirtMC.avs
autolevels_06.dll
Deflicker.dll
Depan.dll
DepanEstimate.dll
Motion_06Dec05B.dll
MVTools.dll
MVTools2.dll
RemoveDirt.dll
RemoveGrain.dll
Warpsharp.dll


==================
Enjoy the script!

Fred.
