==============================================

As you all might know, I'm using machine vision camera's with trigger input for transfering 8mm films to digital.
Until now, I was using an Imaging Source 1024 x 768 pixels camera.
But soon I'm going to upgrade to an IMI 1388 x 1036 camera.
With this camera, it is possible to crop a 1388 x 1036 digital film capturing to 720p without resizing.
With borders, to have the full frame, or without borders but then we are losing parts from the top and the bottom of the frame.
And the 720p HD format is more than enough for the 8mm film format.



For the film transport, I'm using modified film projectors.

The shutter blades and the original lens from the projector are removed.
The original AC motor is replaced by a DC motor. Speed is PWM regulated.

The camera is mounted on the projector, and it is "looking" straight to the film plane, with a macro zoom lens.
For now, I'm using a Computar MLM-3XMP 0.3x -1x 1:45 WD90 (C-mount)


This is, in short,  how the system works:

-There is an optical switch (lightvalve) inside the projector to detect when a new frame arrives in the gate.
-At this point, the frame stands still for a short time.
-The switch sends a pulse to the camera trigger.

-The camera runs internal at a certain framerate, but it grabs one (not debayered) frame and send it to the computer over the fire-wire connection.
-The software grabs this frame, debayer it in real time, and add it to a "growing" AVI file. 

The benefit of this system is that you always have a frame accurate capturing, no matter the speed of the film projector.
The only limit for the speed is the internal frame rate of the camera and the recording speed of the computer harddisk.
I can capture 1024x768 uncompressed RGB24 at 15fps without any dropped frames, on my new 8-core HP computer.
I have an second internal harddisk, reservated for film capturings only.

To hide scrathes, I have developed a little tool for wetgate scanning.
It also cleans the film, and it keeps dirt and hair away from the film gate.
Old dirt spots are very difficult to remove but the RemoveDirtMC() plugin in my film restoring script is removing nearly all of them.
With the wetgate and the script afterwards, 50 years old films are looking like brandnew.



For the backlight, I was using white power Leds, at full brightness.
But I am rebuilding the system for using Frank Vine's special developed CFLed system.
This is a very advanced RGB Led system, it can communicate with the camera and with the special software Frank has written.
You can read all about it here: www.cine2digits.co.uk

For the software, I'm using Frank's custom made D2D app.

The next stage is to combine the Led control software with the capturing software.
This way, a nearly perfect auto white balance will be possible.
We are testing it right now.

As soon as everything works, I will update my super-8 website.
But I do this all in my free time.. this will be something for 2013.

In the mean time.. enjoy the film restoring scripts!

Fred.
